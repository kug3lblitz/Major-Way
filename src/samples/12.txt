Textbook

Linear Algebra and Its Applications (fourth edition) by Lay, Addison-Wesley, 2012. 
(the text is available, for example, at alibris, amazon, barnes and noble, cheapesttextbooks, chegg, fetchbook,
priority, valorebooks). 
Some useful material (including practice exams) can be found here and here.
Course Description

Linear Algebra deals with systems of linear equations, their fundamental properties, and transformations of vector
spaces. The basic objects of the course are vectors and matrices.

Linear algebra techniques are widely used in many areas, such as mathematics, engineering, economics, finance.
They are also cornerstones for a variety of advance classes in science and engineering. The course will describe
basic basic concepts and tools of linear algebra.

We will try to cover the following material: Sections 1.1-1.9, 2.1-2.3, 3.1-3.2, 4.1-4.6, 5.2-5.3, 6.1-6.4. 
We may cover these topics in a different order. Depending on time we may cover more (or delete) topics.
Course Objectives

The following three topics will be emphasized:

1.  the algebra of linear equations and matrices,
2.  the geometry of vector spaces,
3.  algorithms for solving linear equations.

By the end of the class one should know:

to characterize existence, uniqueness and solution sets of systems of linear equations via the row reduction
algorithm,

to perform matrix operations, including inverse and determinant computations,
to characterize vector spaces or subspaces, and determine their dimension and matrix ranks,
to compute eigenvectors and eigenvalues, and perform matrix diagonalization,
concepts of orthogonality and orthogonal bases, carry out orthogonal transformations and projections.

Homework, Quizzes, Tests, and Grading

Homework

Weekly homework will be assigned on Thursday and collected the following Thursday.
The two lowest homework grades will be disregarded.
Please staple your homework, and present the problems in the order assigned, if you want credit.
No late homework will be accepted.

Quizzes, Tests, and Grading

The final grade will be based on homework grades (20 pt), four quizzes (20 pt each), and the comprehensive final
(50 pt).
