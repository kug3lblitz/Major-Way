 

Computer Engineering B.S. Degree Requirements 

 

The Bachelor of Science (B.S.) in Computer Engineering is made up of 125 or 126 credits, depending on 
the track. The major offers two tracks: (1) Systems Architecture (SA) and (2) Communications (COM). 
These tracks share twenty-six common courses as detailed below. In addition, students must take two 
specialized courses for their track, and all Computer Engineering students must complete three technical 
electives.

*These courses must be completed with a 3.0 GPA. CMPE 212 requires a grade of B or better.  

 
 

II. 

Computer Engineering Gateway  

Each student who wishes to earn a B. S. in Computer Engineering must meet the following two Gateway 
requirements:  
 
1) A grade of "B" or better in CMPE 212  
 
2) GPA of at least 3.0 in the following five courses:  

   

a) CMSC 201  
b) CMPE 212  
c) MATH 152  
d) ENGL 100  
e) PHYS 122 

Students must pass the gateway before taking any 300- or 400- level Computer Engineering or Computer 
Science Course, with the exception of CMSC341. Registration for CMSC341 does not require completion 
of the Computer Engineering Gateway.  

III. 

Computer Engineering Tracks  
 

Systems Architecture (SA) Track Requirements (7 credits):  
In addition to the required common core courses, students in the Systems Architecture Track must 
complete:  

  CMPE 315: Principles of VLSI Design  

  CMPE 415: Programmable Logic Devices  

 
Communications (COM) Track Requirements (6 credits):  
In addition to the required common core courses, students in the Communication Engineering Track 
must complete:  
 

  CMPE 323: Signal and Systems Theory  

  CMPE 330: Electromagnetic Waves and Transmission  

 

IV. 

Technical Electives (9 credits):  

Students in both the SA and COM tracks must complete three technical electives. Two of those three 
courses must be upper-level Computer Engineering courses (List A), and the final course, if approved by 
an advisor, may be an upper-level Computer Science course (List B) or a CMPE course (List A).   With the 
approval of the students faculty advisor, graduate courses in Computer Engineering or Electrical 
Engineering may be substituted for undergraduate technical electives.
