SYLLABUS



This is a four credit-hour, calculus-based physics course for students majoring in science or 
engineering.  This course covers basic mechanics and some modern physics.  By the end of 
this semester, you will be able to: 
  Understand a small set of fundamental physical principles 

o  the momentum principle (Newton's laws, conservation of momentum)  
o  the energy principle (conservation of energy) 
o  the angular momentum principle (conservation of angular momentum)  
o  the fundamental assumptions of statistical mechanics  

  Use these principles to explain a wide variety of physical phenomena 
  Use these principles to predict the behavior of a variety of physical systems 
  Model complicated physical systems by making approximations and idealizations in 

order to be able to apply fundamental principles 

  Create 3D animated computer models of physical situations 
The course will emphasize rigorous problem-solving in physics using interactive instruction, 
cooperative learning, educational software, and computer applications important for 
science and engineering students.   

PREREQUISITE  YoumusthavecompletedMATH151,orbeenrolledinitthissemester.

 

The math skills required is a good knowledge of algebra and a basic knowledge of 
derivatives, which can be obtained from a semester of calculus.  No prior experience with 
computer programming is required.  We will teach you everything you need to know for 
the computer modeling that is a component of the course.

  Make sure you have the time required for the course.  You are expected to attend all 
classes  lectures and discussions.  In addition, experience shows that success requires 
atleast8hoursofintensiveeffortoutsideofclass.  If you typically spend much less 
than 8 hours studying for the course, you are unlikely to be successful.  If you typically 
spend much more than 12 hours studying, you should consult with the instructor about 
ways to improve efficiency.  

  Physics is about understanding, not memorization.  Instead of only paying attention to 

the results, it is more important to understandhowtogettheresults.   

  You have manyresources including the textbook, study group, your friends, teaching 

 

assistants, me, YouTube and more.  Use them wisely. 
It is essential to developanabilitytothinkandlearnforyourself.  You must be actively 
engaged to learn the material, you cannot passively watch me or your classmates and 
expect to understand the concepts and develop problem solving skills.  Cognitive 
science has proven that the mind must interact to learn. 

Success in the course is not a piece of cake, but can be achieved with effort and the right 
study strategies.

Blackboard. The class time will be spent on clarifying and applying the materials. 

  Yourparticipation(notmerelyattendance)inthelecturesisrequired with the use of 

clicker.  SeeBlackboardannouncementonhowtoregisteryourclicker. You need to 
bring your clicker (with good battery) to every class.

paper/pencil. 

  The lecturePowerPointslideswillbepostedonBlackboard the night before every 
lecture.  You are expected to print them out to take lecture notes on; it gives you the 
structure of every lecture and facilitates the note-taking process.  But remember these 
slides are not the complete content of the class but only an outline, studying them out 
is not a substitute for attending lectures. 
If you miss one lecture, you are responsible for making up the material.   

 
 
 

Individual  homework  will  be  submitted  via  the  WebAssign online system,  see
BlackboardannouncementonhowtoenrollWebAssign. Homework will be assigned at 
the end of class on Wednesdays and Fridays.  Wednesdays homework is due at 2 am 
on Friday, and Fridays homework is due at 2 am on the next Wednesday.  

  A major part of what I expect you to learn in this class will come as a result of doing 
homework.    You need to fully understand how to solve the assigned homework
problemstodowellontheexamsandtosucceedinthiscourse.   

  Homework questions are noteasy and occasionally you will find yourself spending a lot 
of time on them.  This is expected.  Don'tputoffassignmentsuntilthenightbefore
theyaredue. Start your homework early enough so you have time to get help.   

  TheanswerkeytosomeofthehomeworkquestionswillbepostedonBlackboard. 
  You  are  encouraged  to  work  together,  however,  you  must  fully  understand  how  to 

solve problems on your own to prepare for exams. 

 
  You must attend the discussion section that you are officially registered for.   
  Fullattendanceisrequiredforeverydiscussion.Discussion is based on group work, it's 
designed to provide you with a collaborative learning environment so you can help and 
learn from each other.  To ensure the integrity of group work and the fairness to each 
group member, full attendance is mandatory and therewillbeapenaltyforarriving
late  or leaving early.  20%  will  be  removed  from  the  discussion  score  for  every  five 
minutes that a student is tardy in coming to the discussion.  In addition, those arriving 
late  to  class  will  not  be  allowed  to  benefit  from  the  work  of  students  who  arrive  on 
time. If you are ten minutes late, you will be automatically removed from your original 
group.  You might need to work on your own or join another group.

  There will be oneindiscussionquiz oncomputationalmodeling, see the schedule for 
the exact date. The discussion VPython activities and homework will help you acquire 
the computational problem solving skills youll need.

"By  enrolling  in  this  course,  each  student  assumes  the  responsibilities  of  an  active 
participant  in  UMBC's  scholarly  community  in  which  everyone's  academic  work  and 
behavior  are  held  to  the  highest  standards  of  honesty.  Cheating,  fabrication,  plagiarism, 
and helping others to commit these acts are all forms of academic dishonesty, and they are 
wrong. Academic misconduct could result in disciplinary action that may include, but is not 
limited  to,  suspension  or  dismissal.  To  read  the  full  Student  Academic  Conduct  Policy, 
consult the UMBC Student Handbook.
