Fundamentals  of  Electrics  Circuits,  5th  Ed.,  by  Alexander  and  Sadiku 
(McGraw-Hill)   

 
Prerequisite:  PHSY 122, MATH 225 (co-requisite) 
   
This  course  introduces  the  fundamental  linear  passive  elements  of  resistance, 
 
capacitance, inductance and the physical basis for their current voltage characteristics.    It 
covers the basic analysis of circuits with these linear passive elements including Kirchoff 
laws, node and mesh analysis and a solution of the resulting circuit differential equations 
for  transient  and  steady-state  responses.    The  Laplace  transform  is  presented  with  its 
application to the solution of network problems.    The  transform  (frequency)  domain  in 
introduced.    The  operational  amplifier  and  circuits  using  these  components  is  covered.   
The course includes a laboratory in which the student designs and makes measurements 
on simple test circuits using both real components and PSPICE simulation.

1.  Students learn the basic characteristics of linear circuit elements, including DC and AC 

current and voltage sources, resistors, capacitors, inductors, and transformers.   
2.  Students learn the fundamental laws of circuit analysis, including Ohms Law, 

Kirchhoffs Current Law, and Kirchhoffs Voltage Law. 

3.  Students acquire skill in the application of the basic methods of linear circuit analysis, 

including nodal analysis, mesh analysis, and the use of PSPICE circuit analysis software. 

4.  Students acquire skills in the analysis of first order RL and RC circuits, including the 

determination of initial conditions and computation of transient response. 

5.  Students acquire skills in the analysis of second order RLC circuits, including the 

determination of initial condition and computation of transient response. 

6.  Students  acquire  skills  in  the  analysis  of  circuits  involving  AC  sources,  including  the 
computation  of  complex  impedances,  instantaneous  power,  real  and  average  power, 
reactive power, apparent power and power factor. 

7.  Students become familiar with Bode plots of frequency domain performance. 

8.  Students acquire skill in the application of Thevenins Theorem and Norton Theorem to 
the  analysis  DC  and  AC  circuits,  including  determination  of  the  load  impedance 
necessary form maximum power transfer. 

9.  Students learn the basics of analysis of circuits with magnetic coupling and transformers. 
10.  Students obtain sufficient skills to permit meaningful review and study of other texts and 

technical articles. 

11.  Students develop skills and familiarity with basic linear electrical circuits in a laboratory 
setting, including familiarity with standard test equipment (power sources, breadboards, 
oscilloscopes,  multimeters,  etc.)  and  the  ability  to  perform  basic  circuit  design  and 
implementation.

"By  enrolling  in  this  course,  each  student  assumes  the  responsibilities  of  an  active 
participant  in  UMBC's  scholarly  community  in  which  everyone's  academic  work  and 
behavior  are  to  be  held  to  the  highest  standards  of  honesty.  Cheating,  fabrication, 
plagiarism, and helping others to commit these acts are all forms of academic dishonesty, 
and  they  are  wrong.  Academic  misconduct  could  result  in  disciplinary  action  that  may 
include, but is not limited to, suspension or dismissal. To read the full Student Academic 
Policy,  consult  the  UMBC  Student  Handbook,  the  Faculty  Handbook,  or  the  UMBC 
Policies section of the UMBC Directory." 
 
Late homework and lab reports will not be accepted.    You  may  study  together.    You  must 
do  your  own  work  and  not  copy  from  anyone  else  or  from  the  solutions  obtained 
elsewhere! Copying will result in zero points and cheating on the exams will be reported 
to the department and university.
