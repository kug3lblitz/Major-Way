Based on personal experience of enrolling in STEM majors. Once enrolled, students like us were blindsided with courses with long and intricate course names. Who knew that computer science requires so much math? Well, we found out the hard way. If only other students like us who dream of pursuing STEM majors could use a service that outlines all the different areas of study that they'll encounter in their major. Oh wait, now there is!

Major Way takes the curriculum of your major, and parses through to extract keywords and generates a pie chart that gives you the frequency of the different areas of study that composes your major.
